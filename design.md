# Trustpilot Review Scraper - Product Design Document

## Project Overview
This tool aims to extract reviews from Trustpilot pages, specifically targeting reviews for Data Engineer Academy (dataengineeracademy.com) with star ratings of 1, 4, and 5.

## Requirements

### Data Collection Requirements
1. **Review Content Information**:
   - Full review text content
   - Star rating (1-5)
   - Reviewer name and location
   - Review date
   - "Verified" status indicator (if present)
   - Experience date
   - Company response (if any)

2. **Pagination Handling**:
   - Extract reviews across all available pages
   - Detect total number of reviews
   - Determine reviews per page
   - Navigate through all pages systematically

### Technical Requirements
1. **Parsing Capabilities**:
   - Extract data from HTML structure
   - Handle potential AJAX-loaded content
   - Process any required JavaScript rendering

2. **Resilience**:
   - Implement error handling
   - Add retry logic for failed requests
   - Log errors and exceptions

3. **Output Format**:
   - Store reviews in structured format (JSON/CSV)
   - Include all review metadata
   - Maintain hierarchical structure where appropriate

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **Website Structure Limitations**:
   - Unknown dynamic content loading mechanisms
   - Potential JavaScript dependencies
   - Possible pagination implementation (link-based vs. infinite scroll)

2. **Rate Limiting and Anti-Scraping Considerations**:
   - Unknown request rate limitations
   - Potential IP blocking mechanisms
   - CAPTCHA or other anti-bot technologies

3. **Performance Constraints**:
   - Balancing speed with politeness (not overwhelming the server)
   - Efficient processing of potentially large datasets

### Legal and Ethical Constraints
1. **Terms of Service Compliance**:
   - Trustpilot's scraping policies not yet reviewed
   - Robots.txt restrictions to be determined
   - Potential copyright considerations for review content

2. **Data Usage Limitations**:
   - Personal/internal use vs. commercial redistribution
   - Storage and retention policies
   - Privacy considerations for reviewer identities

## Outstanding Questions

1. **Website Architecture**:
   - Is content statically rendered or loaded via JavaScript?
   - What specific HTML structure contains the review data?
   - How is pagination implemented technically?

2. **Anti-Scraping Measures**:
   - Does Trustpilot actively block scrapers?
   - Are there known techniques to ethically work within their system?
   - Is there an official API that could be used instead?

3. **Data Completeness**:
   - Are there hidden or collapsed sections in reviews?
   - Does the site load all review content at once or progressively?
   - Are there differences in data structure between different star ratings?

4. **Legal Position**:
   - What are the specific terms in Trustpilot's ToS regarding data collection?
   - Are there fair use considerations for the intended use case?

5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Would using Trustpilot's official API be feasible?
   - Are there existing libraries or tools specifically for Trustpilot?
