      "title": "Coaching & Learning Platform Review",
      "text": "I subscribed to the lifetime learning platform along with the 6-month coaching program. Coming from a data analyst background (BI tools, Python, Excel, and SQL), I had no prior experience with data engineering tools.\n\n1) Review of the 6-Month Coaching Program:\n- Personalized learning path: Trainers provide customized modules based on my skills and local job market demands, including a structured learning plan and tailored projects like OLTP, OLAP, or ML-based projects.\n- Career development support: Beyond technical skills, trainers guide resume enhancement, GitHub improvement, blog writing, and job interview strategies from real-world experience.\n- Expert trainers from diverse backgrounds: The three trainers specialize like in GCP, AWS, dbt etc and coming from both corporate and startup environments.\n- Weekly coaching calls & Discord support: Group calls allow live Q&A, though experienced learners might find waiting times long. Discord DMs provide quicker, direct support.\n\nBenefits:\n- Real-world guidance: I gained valuable insights from experienced data engineers, learning both technical and industry best practices in a supportive, non-gatekeeping environment.\n- Identifying blind spots: Trainers pointed out overlooked areas like throttling in streaming pipelines and data governance, helping me improve design and documentation skills.\n- Confidence in project design: My OLTP/OLAP designs were reviewed and validated by industry professionals, boosting my confidence.\n\nChallenges:\n- Misconception about coaching vs. bootcamp: Initially, I expected structured evaluations but later realized coaching is self-driven guidance, not a step-by-step course.\n- Time zone differences: Calls were late at night for me, making myself less productive. But I endure tho.\n- Self-learning required: Solutions aren’t spoon-fed; independent problem-solving is essential.\n\n2) Review of the Learning Platform:\n- Clear and concise content: Modules are broken into short videos, making complex topics easier to grasp. Andreas does a great job of visualizing workflows (e.g., his “Data Science Blueprint”).\n- Wide coverage from basics to advanced topics: Covers Python, security concepts, OLTP/OLAP projects, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).\n\nBenefits:\nSimplified explanations: Topics like data modeling are broken down for easier learning.\n- Lifetime access & diverse tools: Useful for refreshing skills whenever needed.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n- More content on scaling & system design would enhance the end-to-end learning experience.\n- Limited open-source tool coverage, though projects naturally introduce complexity over time and makes sense no platform can ever support such details yet.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis program exceeded my expectations as aspiring data engineer, offering real-world coaching, hands-on projects, and career guidance or even use coaching as consultation session instead. I’d highly recommend it for self-motivated learners ready to put in the effort! DO NOT join coaching if you are hoping to get A-Z code along support and does not have solid time commitment for the project. DO subscribed the learning platform first instead if that the case.",

It requires some extra research on FastAPI's website and other sources to get exercises in some of the lessons to work.\nIt took me a while to figure out how to configure the WSL setup properly. File paths are important, and this isn't covered much in the lessons.\nFor example, when installing UVICORN, there are a couple of warnings \"the script uvicorn was installed (at a certain path) but this path is not in PATH\". After adding the path to Ubuntu PATH, vscode pylance still does not recognize some of the Python packages. (Needed to restart vscode.)

      "text": "There is a lot to be said about Andreas. For one, he coined the term \"Plumbers of Data Science\". It's a great analogy for data engineering!\n\nWhen I first joined his class...I was quite intimidated. Having watched many of his youtube videos, he was easily the most knowledgeable, straight-forward and sharpest of the youtube personalities that I came across. He was a mentor of mine, whose content I watched over and over, educating myself on topics around data engineering and analytics. He had an impressive background, and focused on a niche area I was interested in (data in industry).\n\nHowever, it was humbling being a part of his mentorship program. As sharp, intelligent and wise as he is...Andreas is also a down to Earth nice guy. He was patient when answering questions, shared best practices and processes with his students, helping them structure their own data projects in a methodical way. He entertained my many questions, and was always professional and available for any follow up and help.\n\nOver time, I now consider Andreas a friend, and a data coach. He is a natural teacher, and his content is essential for anyone pursuing learning/work in the field of data engineering and analysis.\n\nHighly recommend Andreas to anyone looking to take their journey in data to the next level!",

I tried my chances and messaged him on LinkedIn requesting for a call to learn from his experience. He was responsive and ready to teach from his experience in the field. In next 3 months I joined the data engineering academy with the pursuit of learning pipeline development in AWS cloud and exploring the monitoring piece in data pipelines. Through the course of next couple of months, Andreas helped me think out of the box and problem solve simple and complex solutions with his extensive experience in the field of data engineering. The discussions and peer and support channels created by Andreas were phenomenal in reaching out to a larger audience and learn from their projects through knowledge sharing and extending a hand at solving someone else's problem. This channel also gave me an open access to understand what kind of data engineering problems are being solved around the globe, technologies different companies prefer, and trends in data across borders. This has truly broadened my perspective in the domain and I'm ever grateful to Andreas.\nAndreas has been a great teacher and an innovative leader in the space of data. His content is to the point and just what is needed to ace in the field. He is up to date with the latest technology and incorporates in his curriculum at the earliest. He is pretty hands on and that is what makes him stand out in the crowd. On a personal note, he's always been available, supportive , and enthusiastic to learn and help. I am more than glad to be connected and mentored by him. He is truly a wonder to work with.",

Then, it was a series of youtube videos on the topic. Then, Andreas started his Learn Data Engineering, a data engineering academy. The format has evolved through the time, but the idea remained the same - to provide learners with step-by-step practical instructions on how to complete a particular task such as to set up a data pipeline on AWS / Azure; to design and deploy a transactional database in MongoDB; etc. So, the biggest value of the Academy for me is in its practicality.\n\nAnother thing I appreciate in Andreas's Academy is that he doesn't bluntly follow the next 'big' and 'trendy' thing on the market and push it to us, rather teaching the basics of de / proven technologies that has been on the market for some time.\n\nOne of the challenges of online courses is the content maintenance as some better ways to approach a task appear/old approaches re-appear. I think this strive for the quality practical content that remain current is what keeps me to remain the Academy subscriber for the last couple of years.",
