      "text": "They Promised What They Didn’t Have – Please Be very Cautious\n\nIf you're planning to pay thousands for Kickstart Interview, please be very careful.\n\nThey sold me a premium coaching package promising tailored mentorship for FAANG interviews — none of which actually existed. As soon as I paid, the support vanished. Meetings were missed, communication was unreliable, and the “tailored” part turned out to be empty words.\n\n⚠️ Important: If they promise anything, don’t take it at face value. If it’s not clearly written in the contract or documented in writing, do NOT sign or pay.\n\nOnce they have your money, you're left with poor support, missed calls, and empty promises.\n\nAsk questions, ask for proof, and don’t trust verbal assurances. I wish someone had warned me — so I’m doing that now.",

The program is well-structured and targets the key areas needed for technical interviews, including data structures, algorithms, and system design. The instructors are knowledgeable, and the mock interviews provided invaluable practice and feedback. It prepares you for interviews within a reasonable time frame. You can retake the course and attend doubt-clearing sessions, which is great for reinforcing what you've learned.\n\nThe program's pace is fast, so you need to be ready to dedicate significant time and effort. It's also on the pricier side, which might be a consideration for some.\n\nYou could prepare for FAANG interviews on your own, but it might take longer, and you could miss out on a structured approach. Interview Kickstart provides that structure and mock interview sessions, which is really helpful.",

      "text": "After completing my CS master's degree, I faced significant challenges entering the software engineering job market. Despite my efforts, I struggled with technical interviews and couldn't advance past the initial application stages. My background did not originally include computer science, and my academic focus did not cover the nuances of coding interviews, like those you find on LeetCode.\n\nRecognizing my gaps, I hesitantly joined IK's early engineering program, which turned out to be a pivotal decision. The program, especially the live DSA sessions led by Omkar and the recorded content, were instrumental. Omkar's deep understanding and clear explanations of data structures and algorithms made complex concepts accessible. Additionally, the mock interviews were invaluable; they not only improved my technical skills using C++ but also taught me how to articulate my thought process effectively during interviews.\n\nSanjeev Qazi, in particular, played a crucial role in enhancing my interview techniques, while my Career Transformation Manager, Snehil Kaushik, provided exceptional guidance in optimizing my resume and honing my responses to behavioral questions.\n\nThe comprehensive support from IK prepared me well for the job market, leading to multiple job offers, including one from Meta. I am immensely grateful for the growth in my problem-solving abilities and interviewing skills, all thanks to my experience at IK.\n\nWith all these said, I want to emphasize that achieving these results requires considerable effort, almost akin to a full-time job. Joining IK doesn't guarantee success on its own; it provides the resources and support needed, but it’s your hard work that will ultimately make you successful.",

Thanks to IK program's effective curriculum, I learned the knowledge behind different algorithms in depth. The instructor has a deep knowledge of computer science and explains it well, making it easy for me to understand things that I didn't understand before. There are selected exercises for every topic. Some of the problems are very difficult and not easy to solve just by listening to the lectures, but there are developers' problem solving lectures for each problem and you can understand and solve the difficult problems by watching them.\nThe lectures are great, but the most valuable part of the program is the mock interviews. Getting feedback from real engineers working in the big techs is an experience that you can never get on your own. You get 10 mock interviews in the program, so you can practice through them and get a much better result if you get a real interview.\nLastly, IK's program requires a large time commitment. It's very hard to study all the content. I didn't watch all the content either, but I tried to watch the important ones and that alone was a big improvement. I think this program will be very effective if you have enough time to do it.",

Now, I’m looking to level up again, this time focusing on transitioning from DevOps to MLOps. Although similar coursework is available elsewhere, the insightful conversations with IK instructors make this course truly worthwhile.\"",

To top it off, you will have access to a very strong support period where you can access a wide variety of AMAs, technical and career coaching, and mock interviews.\n\nOne thing I will say is the Front End program (video content) seemed less structured and comprehensive than the DSA program. Perhaps because the ecosystem is changing often, not sure. Here I began to find myself having to reach for resources outside of the program. Of course, there are still a lot of resources in terms of support and instructor access.\n\nOverall, if you can afford to, and put the time in, you will be happy with the results. This is a kind of program where you will get what you put in, and they will give you resources and support for your effort. You (probably) cannot take this program, put minimal effort in, and expect to gain meaningful results. It's not magic. It will depend on your effort, and this program will teach a lot of useful patterns to approach technical and behavioral problems that will give life to your effort.",

He breaks down various algorithms and complexity into simple patterns that help your grok the concepts and applications. He also provides a great framework for handling system design questions.\n\nOther platform coaches are mostly senior experts in the industry and I've learnt so much their experience as well.\n\nLastly, the IK operations staff is super flexible and supportive and respond immediately to any needs.\n\nIK might appear pricey but personally, I feel it's an investment in one's education and if you can afford it, and are willing to spend time and effort, you won't this. I would VERY highly recommend this and offer all the very best to the platform's promoter team.",

Overall my rating is 1 on 5 because this program is for one who can invest 8 to 10 hours minimum daily for complete 1 year till offer letter if your dream company is not in your hands, otherwise it's atleast 75% costlier if all you want is fundamentals to be clear and strong.",

The concept of study material to prepare before the class and the live classes and working on the problem sets is a great way to drill into the concepts. The problem techniques are taught exceedingly well and the problem set questions are judiciously selected reflecting the current interview trends. All the tutors for live sessions were very knowledgeable and help understand the material better. The foundation materials are exceptional and the way it is taught just imprints it into the mind. The technical and non- technical support team are just superb. Every query is answered promptly. It has been a very challenging but satisfying experience so far and I hope all the hard-work pays off in the future. In a sentence IK training is top notch, rigorous and thorough.

      "text": "I did the 2 month Early Engineering program starting in October 2023 and am almost at the end of my support period, which was supposed to be 6 months long but was extended three times because of a death in my family, a hurricane, and carpal tunnel syndrome. They have been very helpful with that.\n\nOverall, it is pricey but if you have the money and decide to do it, it is very helpful. For me, a guided structure always helps me stick to something, and I followed it as best as I could for nearly the first 2 months. The weekly cycle was: Class on Sunday (4+ hours), assignments to do (coding problems usually equivalent to medium or hard LeetCode questions, thorough video lectures, quizzes), and a coding test on Thursday (1 hour, 2-3 medium programming questions) followed by a lecture and discussion on it. That is for the first 5 weeks, then the next 3 weeks are for non-technical job searching skills. I got a job thanks to a cousin's referral near the end of that 2 months. I got let go after 4 months though so I am now making the most of my support period and all the resources and coaches are still there to help me.\n\nThe most helpful things to me have been: lots of education, practice, and discussion on LeetCode style problems, followed by thorough strategies for job hunting, coding and behavioral interviewing skills, resume, finding referrals, negotiation, etc. They offer live 1:1 coaching and lots of sessions for various topics like coding problems, resume review, interviewing skills, strategy for reaching out to recruiters and aplying, and AMAs.\n\nTheir support always responds within a day and are usually very helpful, including coding and technical questions as well as general issues.\n\nI have gained a lot of value from the program and would recommend it. The most valuable things to me were the mock interviews, frequent technical preparation, thorough technical videos (comparable to Salman Khan's videos from Khan Academy), resume reviews, and walkthroughs and guidance on applying for jobs, and their career workbook (which is an excel document that guided me on thinking about my ideal job, exploring job options available, and preparing for behavioral interviews) all with the help of professional and experienced people from big companies.\n\nTL;DR: In summary, it is pricey, but if you do it, it offers good and structured technical and non-technical preparation and professional guidance and opinions.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Journey",
      "text": "Joining Interview Kickstarter (IK) was a decision influenced by the positive outcomes I witnessed within my professional circle. Initially enrolling in the Backend Engineers domain to expand my front-end skills into more comprehensive roles post-COVID layoffs, IK offered more than I anticipated, prompting me to continue with their Applied GenAI course. This course not only taught the history of AI and the architectures behind mainstream commercial LLMs but also provided hands-on AI project experiences to deepen my understanding.\n\nThe breadth and depth of the curriculum extended into cloud-native systems design, significantly surpassing my initial expectations. However, IK’s impact wasn’t limited to the educational content. The program excels in creating a vibrant community, offering a sense of belonging and a robust support network which were surprising yet invaluable benefits. From one-on-one mock interviews—though these come with a time limit post-completion—to resume workshops and intensive technical interview preparation, IK’s offerings are comprehensive.\n\nThe career services at IK are varied, including professional development through behavioral interview practice, technical interviews, resume workshops, an internal job board, and referrals. This holistic approach is ideal for anyone seeking to make a substantial shift in their tech career or elevate their current trajectory.\n\nDespite the comprehensive resources, landing a role remains challenging, and IK has been supportive, addressing my concerns and aiding wherever possible. However, it’s crucial to note that IK is not a magic solution. The workload is intense, akin to compressing a four-year degree into just four months, which can be overwhelming at times.\n\nDue to the demanding nature of the curriculum, I would hesitate to recommend IK to someone without a STEM background. The program is rigorous, and even students with CS degrees and prior engineering experience find it challenging.\n\nIn summary, while IK provides extensive technical training and a supportive community, the true effectiveness of the program will ultimately be measured by the career advancements of its alumni. As I continue to navigate my professional path, IK’s comprehensive suite of career services and the community I’ve become part of are invaluable assets I’ll continue to rely on.",

Trust me, everything was super useful. In my job search, I used to make many mistakes but things got corrected after going through IKS 6-month curriculum.

They provide a support period and a few mock interview sessions which prepares you for the real life interviews. IK’s management and staffs are also amazing. Any issues you face, their support team always revert on time and extend their help. Anyone who is planning to up level their skills and career, I believe IK is the place to be in.

With my biomedical engineering background, I am not super well versed in Data structures and algorithm compared to someone with a formal \"CS\" college degree. The algorithm study plan helped me a lot to get the fundamentals right. Omkar's lectures have a unique ability to convey complex techniques in a simple language, which is hugely beneficial for non-CS engineers. The curriculum and the choice of problem sets with access to advanced materials , brings in a structure to my interview prep. It saved a lot of hours in deciding what is the best source from the internet and rather focusing on the concepts, not worrying about the source of information. The most I liked is the selection of problems that cover various patterns and relating them. It is very easy to get lost in leet code, trying to solve as much problems as possible, if time is infinite. For full time engineers who are looking for a structured prep, managing current job, family and a career change, IK provides a good template which will save a lot of time and put that focus.\n\nI also wanted to share that IK support from SSA has been very positive in my experience. I had contacted them for several reasons - during lay offs too, every time they gave me a lot of options, to work with my case. Like they say, call them, you can figure out a plan !",

You get to learn real time interview questions from Instructors working at FAANG companies.\nSome areas I believe it can improve is:\n1. It truly helps people who have a background working in the US. But, if guidance for people who should start their career in the US (have worked in different country prior and have a career gap due to relocation - as in my case) was provided - it would have been much appreciated.\n2. Guidance for people who would like to transition to a level up - (Manual to Automation Testing - as in my case) if provided would have been beneficial - For example projects etc.\n3. Topics of SQL and System Design, I believe should have been included in Test Engineering domain.\n4. 1:1 Domain Coaching (just like 1:1 career and 1:1 coding expert connects) if provided, would have been beneficial.\n5. 1:1 session time limit is too short that we can't cover everything in one go and we should wait for couple of days to book another one - However if requested for help - support team would schedule 1.\n\nIt was great journey with iK team. iK Support and instructors' team are humble and responsive.

Every year I get recruited by Amazon, but never made it to the hiring process. It was immensely frustrating given that the companies NEVER give you the feedback, so you may know your weaknesses and work upon them.\nAfter researching multiple tech interview preparation programs, I decided to join Interviewkickstart as they had the best reviews among others. Interview Kickstart has multiple programs and I enrolled in the BackEnd Engineering program. The program is quite comprehensive consisting of course materials, live classrooms every Sunday, homeworks, practice problems, Mock interviews, etc. In addition to covering topics thoroughly, the instructors also gave us general tactics to solve problems belonging to specific topics.\nThe program also covers the behavioral interview preparation and highlights key points to prepare for these types of interviews. This program provides 15 mock interviews for students which is Extremely HELPFUL, as the interviewers are often from FAANG companies like Google, Facebook or Amazon and give Detailed feedback at the end of the interview focusing on strengths and weaknesses and advice on how to improve upon weak areas. Furthermore, the program offers optional classroom sessions regarding job search, improving resume to better fit JD, negotiating salary, etc. It probably seems to be alot given practicing for coding interviews, but it is worth it.",

I always received quick replies and felt that any feedback I provided was sincerely received as they are continually looking for ways to improve their programs. I am looking to cross the finish line soon in my job search, and I will owe many thanks to Interview Kickstart.",

      "text": "Fantastic content and outstanding instructors!!\n\nI'm currently enrolled in the engineering management course with IK, and mastering FAANG interviews is truly an art, skillfully addressed by IK. They offer a wealth of high-quality content in one convenient place, sparing us the need for trial and error and extensive online research. The instructors, hailing from FAANG+ companies, bring expertise and practical knowledge to their teaching. I've completed the behavioral interview preparation and am now delving into the intricacies of system design. Overall, my experience with this course has been enjoyable.\n\nIK's exceptional support is worth highlighting. Whenever I've reached out to the support team with requests, they have responded promptly and effectively resolved my queries.\n\nThe resources and lectures on System Design and Backend Development provided by IK have been instrumental in reshaping my approach, encouraging me to reconsider my strategies and assisting me in coding and designing scalable systems.\n\nThe process of preparing for interviews often feels like an overwhelming loop, with an abundance of content available online, each emphasizing specific topics. Watching IK's videos gave me a glimpse of the course's quality. Moreover, the anxiety I typically experience during interviews, even for problems I've previously solved, has diminished with IK's well-organized content. The course focuses on solving problems within specific coding patterns, eliminating the need to obsess over every problem on platforms like Leetcode. The inclusion of Mock Interviews with valuable feedback is particularly beneficial. Understanding how we are assessed during a mock interview has significantly informed my preparation style and boosted my confidence in interviews with various companies. The course actively seeks feedback at different stages, ensuring that input is considered and incorporated.\n\nThe customer support team has consistently proven helpful, delivering prompt responses at any time of the day when contacted for assistance.\n\nI hope this review proves valuable to others as they make informed decisions about their preparation journey!",

      "text": "I joined interview kickstart in the hopes of streamlining the process of preparing for big tech interviews for me, as I do not have a lot of free-time to collate content, decide whats the most valuable content, and also study it, in between work and other duties.\n\nI am overall greatly pleased with my decision and the IK program. The instructors are current or ex Big-Tech/FAANG employees who have first hand knowledge of the interview process at big tech, all the nuances involved from pre-application, application, recruitment, phone-screen, technical interviews, behavioral interviews, negotiation, etc.\n\nHaving access to those FAANG and Big Tech employees is, by itself, an incredibly valuable asset. However, IK also offers collated content for you to study, and teaching for the content is offered by some of these same big-tech employees.\n\nAssignments are offered after each live sessions class for you to implement what you have just been lectured on and build a practical understanding of the material you just covered. Every week, a quiz is offered depending on what program you are in, or a review session for the assignment is held to clear up any doubts.\n\nIK thus has a well-tuned machine that follows an academic, university like structure in how the content is taught, reinforced, and tested.\n\nMock Interviews are also available for you to practice interviews in real-time, in an interview like setting, to actually implement everything you have been studying and see if you are, in fact, interview ready prior to any big interviews you may have. These mock interviews are also lead by current or ex Big Tech employees.\n\nIK is a great program, it is separate from boot-camps in that it teaches you not only the relevant content, but ties it all together to the interview process from end-to-end (the process I wrote about above).\n\nI give the program 5 stars because I would recommend it to others, but I will also offer points of improvement so that this doesn't seem like a fake review.\n\nFor some programs, IK could offer \"better\" or \"more relevant\" content for the topic of that week. There is plenty of supplemental material which I have not reviewed, so its quite possible that content is present there, but I find that for some programs, the content could use a refresher.\n\nFinally, student success advocates (which IK claims are offered and available) could do a much better job keeping in contact with the students.\n\nThere is no real sense of \"community\" at IK, so if you make the investment to join the program, realize that it is on you to be diligent about completing all assignments and attending live class sessions.",

      "text": "I received a job offer from Meta at E5 in the Realty labs division. I was technically strong and did not need any help there. The place where I missed was always behavioral interviews. I heard a lot about IKS and called them to find out which workshop would suit me the best. Abhishek from IKS called and explained me several options and we concluded that the EM workshop with 6 behavioral mocks would be the right one and the price was 2400$. I felt it was a little high but wanted to give it a try. I went through all the videos thoroughly and the questions asked in Meta were exactly the same which means IKS instructors keep themselves up-to-date with what is being asked.\n\nI used only 4 out of the 6 mock interviews and they were with senior leaders at Apple, Microsoft, Amazon. The feedback was very clear and I had a clear idea where I missed. I was able to control my actual interview very well and I was not at all panicked because of preparation.\n\nGetting hired at FAANG companies is just a matter of commitment and preparation. Please spend the time and money for yourself and get a career and life that you deserve. This is my final conclusion.\n\nHats off to IKS and its instructors.",

      "text": "TLDR; It is a difficult program geared to build your skills to a level where you feel comfortable presenting in an interview.\n\nThe most benefit for the buck you spent here is the organized method of attacking the interview problem both in coding, scalable design, and in my case, ML design examples. But after knowing the steps, you have to put the hours to do the work yourself, meaning leet code training, scalable design training, etc.\n\nThe examples are not always perfect, the videos are not always great, but the program as a whole is valuable nevertheless if you don't have much experience with coding and design interviews. They also do resume building and help with strategizing your calls with the coaches.\n\nIn my opinion, this program is perfect for those who have been winging it throughout their career to land on a job and wanted to apply to a bigger named company that has a standardize or test-like approach to interviewing. It is like taking a course for an SAT or ACT test. Can you do without it? yes, but if you need the help, this is one of the best out there.\n\nIn my experience, I'm taking the online-only course. It is video only with no live classes with technical coaches if I have questions. The live classes would probably better, but my schedule doesn't work out. The recordings by Omkar are very helpful for the coding sections. For someone who didn't have much design experience, the scalable design and ML design videos are super useful. But, I can see that it may not be so for those who are more experienced (and if it is you, that's a good thing, it means you're ready). I'm able to get a lot of help with my resume building. My success manager, Ajita, she was very patient in answering my questions. Due to my schedule, my learning rate is much slower than I wanted it to be, but one of the IK operations, Diksha, was able to help me to adapt the program to my needs. It was a pleasant experience overall, and if you are being reasonable, the people there are very reasonable as well, and I would highly recommend this program.",

I can say that the most valuable about this program are actually the instructors with most of them being real experts on their fields(PhD holders) and actually working in FANG companies, so the advice and the coaching you get from them is actually worth all the money you pay for the course. The content is fine and could be improved, even though it could be found also in some other platforms or books, what makes it more valuable is the structure that IK gives to the program to present the content in a relevant manner so all the topics you need to know before hand an important topic are taught weeks before. You need to be conscious that to take advantage of what the program offers you need to put in the hours of study and effort, because without that even the best training in the world will not work. So far after attempting many other courses to advance my career IK program has been the one that has given a better result. So highly recommend everyone that is trying to advance on their career to try IK programs.",

The algorithms were presented in a language-agnostic manner, making it accessible to those comfortable with any Object-Oriented Programming language.\n\nHowever, the live sessions conducted by the Indian instructors left much to be desired, with the exception of Akshat, Komal, and Tarun. Their explanations were on par with that of competing Indian Ed-tech companies, which are usually poor and robotic. What was even more surprising was one of the instructors wearing a T-shirt with a logo from a competing firm during one of the live sessions.\n\nThat being said, what truly made the program valuable was gaining access to the recordings of Mr. Omkar Deshpande's live sessions. His classes were exceptional and had the power to ignite a genuine passion for Algorithms. Preparing for technical interviews can be challenging and often disheartening, but Omkar's teaching makes it a rewarding experience. I credit my software engineering career to him.\n\nFinally, my success would not have been possible without the unwavering support of the entire team at IK Ops. In particular, I'd like to express my gratitude to Miss Kriti Mamgain, who served as my initial point of contact for any requests. It's truly remarkable to see IK Ops available to address your needs seven days a week with remarkably fast responses. They deserve as much recognition as the instructors.\n\nI look forward to the possibility of returning to join the ML switch-up program in the near future, as long as Omkar's videos remain accessible.",

Despite my commitment to the program, I found that the methods they used were ineffective in helping me improve my interview skills.

As advertised, they claim to offer a refund if you are not satisfied with the program. However, when I contacted their customer support to request a refund, I was met with multiple hurdles and uncooperative staff. Their response was slow, and I was given a runaround.\nDo not buy Interview Kickstart. Their program failed to deliver results, and their customer service was unresponsive and unhelpful.
