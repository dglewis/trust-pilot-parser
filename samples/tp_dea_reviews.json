I am a Software Engineer contractor and my contract was about to expire and I was having trouble finding a new Contract or full-time position. SInce I started at the Data Engineering Academy they have helped me clean up my resume and target the Data Engineering skills I was having trouble with. I wasn't getting any responses when I placed my old resume on the internet but the changes we made have turned that around. The Data Engineering Academy has also helped me with my Data Engineering skills. My resume is getting noticed and I have had several interviews with two companies moving into the third interview phase. These are full-time positions not Contracts! It has gone from no response to dozens of calls a day. The last time I looked for a position was 7 years ago. At the time I could land a contract position in a couple of days. I found the job market has changed. If you don't have a polished resume and the skills that are in demand right now you will struggle finding a new position. DE Academy has helped me with every area that I needed improvement. I can actually say the DE academy has saved my career.",

These classes were poorly structured, and the online group meetings were uninspiring. Scheduling one-on-one sessions could take anywhere from a week to a month, which is inefficient.\n\nCompared to other educational experiences I've had, which were more affordable and better designed, this program has been a letdown. With the added interest on loans, I find myself paying $12K for a service that has not met my expectations.\n\nIt's nearly a year since I joined, and despite multiple requests for a partial refund at the three and six-month marks—which were all denied—I haven't progressed from where I started. I am still jobless after all this time and money invested.\n\nMy recent one-on-one for an assessment test was disappointing. I hoped for guidance on how to leverage my experience for the role I'm interested in, but instead, I received basic advice on how to use tools like ChatGPT or DeepSeek—something I could manage on my own without such a hefty fee.\n\nOverall, my experience with this company has been highly unsatisfactory.

From the very beginning, I had a gut feeling that this program would help me break into the job market, and that feeling is still going strong.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Data Engineering Academy is the financial flexibility they offer. Their various payment plans make it much easier for students, especially international students like me, who might be on a loan or have limited funds to invest. They truly support you in every way possible, and I personally received excellent guidance in navigating these options.\n\nBeyond finances, the mentorship here has been incredible. My mentor has been extremely motivating and supportive, guiding me through resume preparation and coursework. I have learned so much under his mentorship, and I continue to grow every day. While I can’t say for sure when I’ll land a job, the knowledge and confidence I’m gaining make me feel optimistic that success is just around the corner.\n\nRegardless of what you've studied before—whether in your Master’s or Bachelor's degree—this course provides a fresh start. Even if you have zero prior experience, Data Engineering Academy equips you with the right skills to kickstart your career. I’m truly grateful for this journey, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enter the data engineering field!",

      "text": "My experience with Data Engineering Academy so far is really great. It’s because it’s really exciting that various types of data can be manipulated with Select Query Language (SQL), which is a programming that relates to Databases. Also the instructors and staff members of the Academy do a really fantastic job of communicating with me about the my progress with the curriculum. Also they’re very open to helping me gain a clear understanding the the learning material.\n\nI’m right about at the point where I’m finishing up with the SQL course and beginning with Python.\n\nI’m looking forward to learning more about the concepts of Data Engineering with the DE Academy. I’m also excited to see where it will potentially lead me to in the near future.\n\nUpdate 10 minutes after writing initial review:\n\nBefore joining DE Academy, my goals were to eventually work in software development. It’s because I felt as if it would be really great to work in a field that involves making computers communicate with the world around them. I didn’t have any doubts or challenges about learning data engineering. It’s because I’ve been exposed to Database and SQL (Select Query Language) before. I found it fascinating that it’s an extremely useful method of deriving detailed information from spreadsheets.\n\nI enjoyed the program in that the instruction in SQL is very involved. I’m taught various ways to derive info from databases in order to fine-tune specific information that is helpful to various corporations.\n\nThe instructors are very helpful; they provide a variety of different job aids for helping to master the material.\n\nSince joining, I’m steadily improving as far as knowing how to derive specific types of information with SQL. I’m also just now learning the basics of Python, which is a programming language that’s useful for various applications, one of them being data engineering.\n\nI’d recommend checking into the DE Academy to see if it would be a good fit. For a person who loves learning about technology, if nothing else, it would expose a person to various aspects of the data engineering field. This would help the individual to decide which path he or she would like to take forward in life.\n\nUpdated the above on March 13, 2025",

The materials are exceptionally well-organized, eliminating any guesswork. The program is structured with clear discipline—setting proper expectations, accounting for my baseline skills, and providing personalized gap analysis that shows exactly where I need to focus to succeed.\n\nThank you!

They also provide a lot of support outside of coding itself: interviews, resumes, etc. Everyone is very friendly and excited for you to learn. I'd say my experience is generally positive & you will learn something. I feel at times that it almost assumes you know how to do some of the more advanced steps without teaching you.

After much research and multiple conversations with DEA representatives, I determined this was an investment in myself and my career.\n\nI am fully confident that this program will provide me with the skills I need to jump in to the data engineering field.

The instructors are available if you need help with your course work, which can include difficult coding exercises, mock interviews, and solid, professional job prep exercises – all of which are crucial to learn and master for success. Instructors and Success Coaches will take the time to help students who may or may not be struggling with the more difficult concepts, taking the time to explain them to the student so that there is a complete understanding. That time with your success coaches is unbelievably valuable to you as a student.\n\nThe curriculum is centered around the student and what that student wants to achieve. DE Academy offers vast experience with interactive classes that allow you to ask questions of the instructors and get solutions in real time. Instructors take the time to explain “why” and “how” the data is used, and “where” it can be best utilized.\n\nSuccess coaches at DE Academy are incredibly dedicated and genuinely care about each student's individual needs, fostering a supportive learning environment where students feel encouraged to reach their full potential. The courses are straightforward, engaging, and noticeably clear in helping students gain the technical knowledge to be successful.\n\nI now feel more confident in my abilities in the data world and would highly suggest DE Academy to others who are wanting to try something different and learn new skills to become the best you can be.\nThe interactive format at DE Academy facilitates learning. The facilitators (instructors) provide valuable feedback to help students fully understand the value of what they are doing, and I felt motivated to continue my education.\n\nI highly recommend the great people at DE Academy and the quality learning environment the academy offers!!!",

Speaking with multiple Success coaches they listened to my concerns and frustrations, and to be honest my ranting, but through all the despair, anxiety we were able to settle and meet on level ground. I know we scaled back my learning stilling allowing me to advance my skills but more at my pace minus the 1-on-1, but it is something I am ok with as I may after taking a break can come back with in a more positive mental state to finish.

      "text": "After getting laid off from my previous job (non-tech) I came across DEA. I came with zero coding and a little bit of Excel experience, but I had developed an interest in data. Coming from a non-tech background and already in my mid-career looking to transition, I knew I needed specialized guidance since the odds were against me. Yes, DEA's tuition was expensive, which required an extensive discussion from my partner, but ultimately the tailored 1:1 mentorship and the support with my applications made it a no-brainer since it would help me offload a significant amount of time and emotional fluctuations. The course platform and my mentors taught me SQL and Python from scratch, as well as other tools such as AWS products and dbt. It also offered a plethora of tangible projects (where my mentor helped with debugging and understanding its use in the real-world), library of tutorials (including LeetCode-type questions for SQL, Python, and Pandas). Fortunately I was able to study full-time and within 6 months from enrollment, I got an offer as a Data Engineer at a startup. The program continues to develop with more lesson modules, community forums, group classes, etc. things they didn't have yet when I first joined - so I continue to study with them to help me prepare for more competitive roles and quickly grow my career in this field.",

Their hands-on projects allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world situations, increasing my confidence and ability in this fresh field.\n\nThanks to DE Academy, I not only got technical knowledge but also developed the mindset of a data engineer.",

The gap method helped me learn what’s out there in industry instead of struggling for weeks hoping the job I get an interview for is applicable… If you take the program seriously, take notes on the videos, and try hard during the mock interviews it is worth every penny.\n\nIn tech, there is no road map to navigate a successful career.

It's plain wrong.\n\nAnyhow, a LOT of more questions came my way, only to say that I did qualify for their Personalized Training. Since I am a seasoned corp-exec with 20+ years of experience, he told me that I could become a member of their Diamond Program, for an unreasonably high amount of money.\n\nAlthough I should have ended the call at that point, I kept on listening to try to understand what could cost that much money. That's when he started talking about the gap method and showed me how it's implemented and more. In other words, exactly the same process that an entry-level aspiring data scientist would get!\n\nHe also mentioned that I would have the full engagement of the founder in my case and a guaranteed job offer.\n\nWhen I asked if I could talk to other C-suite clients enrolled in the Diamond Program, the answer was, \"Sorry, but we don't usually do that.\" This triggered all the alarms.\n\nA company selling training packages that is not willing to let their premium customers talk to each other, and share experiences, clearly is not worth the time or the money. Especially not that amount of money!!",

The course material was extremely weak, often outdated, incomplete, or even inaccurate. Instead of engaging, skill-building projects, the assignments felt more like basic \"paint-by-numbers\" tasks, offering little opportunity for real growth. Collaboration and team-building exercises were almost nonexistent, which is a huge missed opportunity for a program of this nature.\n\nThe program demands a significant time commitment—equivalent to a second job—but the support structure doesn’t justify this level of effort. Many instructors are in vastly different time zones, making it nearly impossible to schedule meetings. Even when meetings do happen, some instructors lack interpersonal skills and can come across as snippy or rude.\n\nOn top of that, communication relies on the free version of Slack, which was a red flag from the start. When the free trial expires, you have to jump through hoops to maintain access to the instructors. A more robust and accessible platform like Discord would have been a much better choice.\n\nGiven the cost of the program, I expected a much higher return on investment. Unfortunately, the course fell short. For the same price, you could gain far more value by pursuing certifications, books, or other resources that provide comprehensive and up-to-date material. While the concept of the academy is promising, its poor execution makes it difficult to recommend.",

They re-personalized my course to better suit my learning style and level of understanding. Stefan, in particular, was incredibly dedicated. He took extra time to break down complex Python concepts into simpler and also supplemented the lessons with additional resources from external sources, ensuring I had all the tools I needed to succeed.\n\nThe personalized attention and encouragement I received were pivotal in my learning journey. Thanks to their efforts, I not only overcame my initial struggles but also gained confidence in my ability to tackle IT challenges now im done with the python and im doing pandas. I highly recommend this bootcamp to anyone, especially those without a background in IT. Their commitment to student success is truly remarkable.\n\nOne more thing, Use the slack channel to communicate your challenges and struggles and if you new in the IT field, let the emphasizes be on that, so that they can tailor the course outline to fit you which might be different from those who already have a background in It!",

      "text": "Joining the Data Engineer Academy has been a transformative experience for me. Before enrolling, I struggled to find a comprehensive, end-to-end data engineering course. But the DE Academy had just what I needed, offering a curriculum that takes students from scratch to mastery.\n\nThe coaches here are incredibly skilled and experienced, delivering well-thought-out lectures across all sections. In just 1.5 months, I've seen a significant shift in my approach to data engineering, thanks to the real-world examples in SQL and data modeling. These projects have truly changed the way I think about and handle difficult data problems.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of DE Academy is their emphasis on real-world examples and practice. Everyone looks for hands-on experience to master this role, and DE Academy has designed their course with a strong focus on real-world problems. I found that 95% of my time was spent working with real-world scenarios, rather than just focusing on theoretical concepts.\n\nThe one-on-one mentorship has been exceptional, providing personalized guidance and support every step of the way. The customer service is also top-notch.\n\nI'm grateful for the hands-on experience and the knowledge I've gained so far. The DE Academy has exceeded my expectations, and I can't wait to see what the rest of the course has in store!",

      "text": "I am so excited to share my experience with DE Academy's coaching service! As someone treading the turbulent waters of today's job market, I can confidently say that their support and guidance have been nothing short of invaluable. From the personal assessment that kicked off the coaching process, I could tell that my coach—and the program as a whole—was fully invested in my success. The assessment was spot-on, providing a solid understanding of my skills and abilities and, more importantly, helping me figure out what I really want to do—as well as what I don't want to do.\n\nThe resources that DE Academy provides are of the highest quality. I have been immersing myself in the curriculum, which spans the range of data engineering topics, including SQL and Python. With the kind of deep-dive practice that their materials enable, I have no doubt that I will be proficient in these tools by the time I really need to use them. I've also been making use of their Q&A sessions, where I've received some really solid advice and clarity on certain topics. Another feature of their service that I regard as outstanding is the mock interviews. I mean, who doesn't love a good confidence boost?\n\nMoreover, they have a very meticulous process in place when it comes to reviewing resumes. I was quite impressed with how they took my resume and helped me turn it into something better—something that really highlights my strengths. I am now part of the \"Apply for Me\" program, which is probably the best thing that's ever happened to me. These people are applying to jobs on my behalf. That saves me so much time! And they're negotiating for me as well, which is great since I am pretty terrible at that.\n\nIn every way, DE Academy has gone above and beyond my expectations, and I sincerely appreciate their commitment and knowledge. For anyone seeking a thorough coaching service that genuinely has your best interests in mind and really wants you to prosper, I can't recommend DE Academy enough. The coaches there have the experience and know-how to help you navigate your journey. I’m excited to see what’s next for me and know they’ve set me up well for whatever outcome is in store.",

I had taken on some boot camps but didn’t have any guidance on how to approach interviews or even write a competitive resume. I thought long and hard about what next steps to take and lo-and-behold, I got a referral from an acquaintance who’s wife joined DE and had a job in just a few months. I thought to myself no way and felt it was too good to be true but was going through tough times so decided to lookup DE Academy online to find out for myself. I watched some interesting testimonials from some DE academy alumni and that boosted my confidence even more because they spoke about how DE supports you throughout the bootcamp and even after during the job application face.\nFast forward, on 8th May 2024 I joined DE academy to study to become a full time data engineer. Just yesterday I got hired for a senior data engineering role which pays over $180k yearly and I’m just overfilled with joy.\nThis was possible because of the assistance I had from the DE Academy coaches in building a resume to fit my background, working on behavioral questions for interviews and working on real-life data engineering projects to equip me with the necessary skills to prepare me for the job market. The frequent check-ins with the Customer Success Manager (Chucks) also encouraged me in areas where I was having difficulty and reached out to coaches on areas where they needed to help me get better.\nThe journey was not an easy one but with strength from God and dedication I was able to achieve what I doubted to be possible.\nBig shoutout to Azmat, Nikola, Milada, Ninad and Chris for all the help in building me to become an expert in Data Engineering.\nI encourage everyone to join DE academy as I believe they are the best in equipping you with the necessary tools to be job ready in Data Engineering and Data Analyst respectively.\nAlso, challenge yourselves to put in extra work when working on the personalized plan created for you when you join DE. There might be times when you hit roadblocks especially if you are a beginner in the field, but taking advantage of the slack channels to reach out to the coaches and also joining the Q&A sessions will answer most of the questions you have. Personal research using sources like ChatGPT and YouTube are also highly encouraged.\nI wish everyone who plans to join DE Academy the best and wish they land their dream roles as I believe it’s very very very possible.",

      "text": "Hi, this is an update to a previous review. My initial experience with DEA and their representative Jason was really bad, he was not capable of telling me more about DEA and repeatedly insulted me for what I didn't already know about them, amongst other things. However, I recognize that the experience with their new salesperson doesn't necessarily reflect the overall academy. Chris (the founder) found out about my bad experience through my negative review and took action to turn things around for me. He called me himself and apologized. He gave me access to some resources to help me learn more about data engineering and offered to give me a mock interview. I also did a re-do of the discovery call with someone who had more tenure at DEA and it was much more pleasant, and I was able to learn more about what they have to offer.\n\nA few positive things I'll say about their coaching program is that at the mid-price level they offer unlimited mock interviews and one on one time. This is a higher level of attention and support than the program I ended up signing up with (at a similar price point). They also stick with you until you find a job, and expressed that is something they really care about. I wish they were more transparent about their pricing, but I do like that they are flexible with it. They have three pricing tiers for the coaching, and unlike other places they can adjust within those tiers if you don't need everything.\n\nFor their online trainings, I'll say that it seems expensive for the quality and production value of the trainings. I have been taking classes on Udemy, which vary widely, but since this is at a more premier price I was hoping it would be more polished. That said, I think that their curriculum is a better, more practical match for someone looking for a single program to learn Data Engineering than the other classes I have looked at. There are other classes out there on these topics, but DEA brings it all together into one curriculum. The content I have seen so far seems like it would be approachable for someone with less experience. I like the interview question content that they have so far, I would just expand it into additional topics (they have questions for three specific topics, instead of overall Data Engineering questions so it has gaps).\n\nI am not a graduate of the program and have just checked out some of their content so far, so my review is not for the overall experience. However, I think if you're someone who is interested in Data Engineering and are seeking more support and 1:1 coaching, this is a good option to look into.",
