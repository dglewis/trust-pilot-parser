I was also asked to handle an aws data engineering project. I wanted to understand more on aws. I had seen some feedback on Sachin course and took a leap of faith.\nThe biggest validation that I received was when I was able to recommend some performance improvements using step functions. From preparing PPT for clients t presentations to providing feedback on saving cloud costs was a big win win. The customer who was so used to me presenting slides on where we stand during the steering committee meetings was surprised when I along with my team proposed various cost saving mechanism. I would say jump into this course. The knowledge that you will get when other folks pitch in their experience is second to none. Worth every rupee.",

      "text": "Skill and real-time project experience cannot be earned; it's achieved by trying different projects with all possible edge scenarios. RADE is not just a program; it’s a real-time big solution that understands the data flow. Discussing with my mentor and going through the real game of data engineering concepts is tough; however, it can be achieved by having Sachin at your side and discussing with you.\nWorking in a real project and understanding the data ecosystem is always challenging without understanding all the AWS data engineering concepts. You need to work on each service like s3, glue, Redshift, lambda, Athena, Fargate, EMR, SNS, and SQS to give the best solution with perspective of cost and time. I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to Sachin for your incredible guidance and support throughout the real-time project. Being clear on the topics one by one & carrying out the hackathon as a team is awesome. Your experience and insights have been invaluable, and they have truly shaped my understanding and given another perspective and insight to approach the challenges in a practical, real AWS data world context.\nThis is an incredible journey. Thanks for being a mentor and true Friend. I highly recommend his RADE program to all AWS data engineers and leads.\nRegards,\nManoj.",

While searching for resources on LinkedIn, I discovered a Sachin whose course turned out to be a game-changer .\nThe course provided extensive knowledge of essential AWS services for data engineering, such as Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon EMR. Each service was explained in detail with realtime examples. The sessions are practical and were invaluable. They allowed me to build and manage data pipelines, process large-scale data, and implement ETL workflows. This hands-on experience made me comfortable working in the AWS environment.\nHis teaching style was clear and engaging. He broke down complex concepts into manageable steps, making it easier to grasp even advanced topics like orchestration using step function and Airflow .In his session he explains us about the Real-world use-cases from Aws blogs like setting up data lakes , usage of glue bookmarks and orchestrate Amazon Redshift based ETL workflows .These projects boosted my confidence and prepared me for on-the-job challenges.",

      "text": "I recently completed the AWS Data Engineering course (RADE™: 100 Days AWS Data Engineering Challenge + Hackathon), organiseed and run by Sachin. I was delighted and impressed with the quality of learning provided by Sachin in this course. He has deep knowledge of AWS dataa related services, and his knack to explain very complex topics in clear succinct manner, made my learning experience truly outstanding. Sachin introduced and guided us through a wide range of AWS data technologies, including S3, Lambda, Athena, ECS Fargate, Redshift, Glue and many more. What set him apart was how he connected these tools/technologies to real-world data engineering scenarios, making it easier for us to grasp how they are used in practice. He made even the most challenging concepts, easier to understand via through practical examples and hands-on labs. One of the best aspects of the course was Sachin’s emphasis on hands-on learning. He ensured that we weren’t just absorbing theory but actively applying what we learned through well-structured labs and assignments. His patient and thorough explanations during Q&A sessions helped us remove all our queries and doubts. By the end of the course, I got confidence that using the learnings and knowledge shared by Sachin, I should be able to design and build data solutions using AWS services for data related real world challenges faced by the organizations. I would highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to build their expertise in AWS data engineering, whether they are beginners or looking to advance their skills. Thank you, Sachin, for a great exceptional learning experience!",

He shares job postings, interview questions, and tips on LinkedIn profile building, which is really helpful for anyone looking to transition into a data engineering role.\n\nOne thing I found challenging is that the hands-on projects are quite large. Since I have a full-time job, it’s hard to find time to complete them on my own. He does an end-to-end demonstration, which is great for understanding, but smaller, focused tasks as homework would make it easier to practice step by step.\n\nI highly recommend this course to anyone serious about AWS Data Engineering.

I have been working in the DWH/ETL world for the past 14 years and wanted to make a switch to AWS cloud. I tried multiple courses on Udemy and other websites. Those courses were useful, but they were focusing on several other aspects of AWS which are not required by a data engineer, and I was especially looking for hands-on classes to understand how AWS works in a real project and what tasks a data engineer needs to achieve.\n\nSachin's course is exactly at the point where it teaches us about different components that are heavily required for a data engineer along with components which we need to have a little understanding of. Also, he made sure that the course is not a 100% perfect project; he has built project on the fly and shown what errors we encounter in real projects.\n\nAt last, I am really happy that I enrolled for this course as I was able to get real hands-on AWS services which are used in the real world. If you are looking for real project learning for AWS focusing on the data engineering module, then this is the best fit, but also make sure you need to practice along with the course for getting a better understanding and grasping the concepts with more clarity.",

      "text": "Hi Folks,\n\nI was very much curious to know more about real world data engineering courses on the web in AWS space and one day i got to see a LinkedIn post by Sachin where he shared his experience which was very relatable to me , i was working mostly on on-prem and recently moved to cloud role, so I wanted to improve my skill set to deliver better at my work and yes as everyone wants aiming for that jinga dala switch which can improve my lifestyle.\n\nTo all the folks who are planning to upskill and see some real world AWS solutions , I would highly recommend this program who wants to deep dive into AWS Data engineering.\n\nThe program gives you exposure to\nDeep Dive content - Where you just don't copy paste the code but sachin gives you an opportunity to go out and explore before you start the the next material in the deep dive content and honestly the deep dive content is worth your time.\n\nSpeaking about our weekly calls we celebrate peers success stories who have transitioned to amazing roles and also brainstorm or prep on the next hackathon calls.\n\nApart from this you get access to some real time quality discussions on data engineering field hosted by Sachin among the peers.\n\nIf you are thinking about joining this course , i can honestly say\n1) if you have dedicated sincerely you will be a more knowledgeable person by the end of this course and can look for better opportunities in market.\n2) The live hackathon build your data engineering muscles for sure, also I have seen very experienced people join this program with the hunger and desire to refresh their knowledge, i personally got to hear so much of industry experience on live hackathons sessions.\n3) You will feel more confident about yourself for sure.\n\nHappy Upskilling :)",

Sachin has loads of knowledge and real-time experience in this field which makes it easier for him to propose scenarios/solutions to each and every use case we come up with as part of our questions/doubts.
